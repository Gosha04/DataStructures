Source Files: main.cpp MonoStack.h SpeakerView.h

Errors and Limitations: 
I had my output output a doubled number one time. It was something like 121.4 90.5 121.4 72.1. I haven't been able to replicate
this at all and I'm not sure how it happened in the first place but it may occur again.

Refrences:
I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterators-c-stl/ and https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/iterator to figure out how
to properly use an iterator to read my input file

Compile: g++ -o stack main.cpp 

Run: ./stack input
